Dymo Printer 450 Turbo 550 Turbo 4XL 5XL

I used the turbo 450 to print label, reading data from sql, like names and addresses. Used the SDK and Dymo Software. Pretty easy to create a label, name the fields like Fname, LName, Address1, Address2, Address3 and then you can feed the label from the data source and print. Now with the DymoConnect it was a challenge first you need to create the labels from scratch because they are not compatible with Dymo Software, second when you add objects to the label you can't name the objects, without know the names of the objects/fields in your label how can pass the right information to print? well here I solved that. maybe I did not do much research but I was able to print from the 550 Turbo passing values to the objects/fields I create inside the label.
